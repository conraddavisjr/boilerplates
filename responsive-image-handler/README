responsive-image-handler(RIH) automates responsive image handling.

---------------
USE CASE
---------------
When you have a lot of image variations throughout your breakpoints and would benefit from a naming convention for images i.e "yourImgName_S.png" and "yourImgName_L.png"


---------------
HOW IT WORKS
---------------

By default, RIH accepts a series of breakpoints by order from S(small) to XL(extra-large) with declared scale(browser width) values and a corresponding name value.
The name value is used to append a string to the end of an image's src thus load an image that corresponds with the current browser size (width).

************************************

		breakPoints : {
			S:{
				scale:"480",
				name: "_S."
			},
			M:{
				scale:"768",
				name: "_M."
			},
			L:{
				scale:"960",
				name: "_L."
			},
			XL:{
				scale:"1300",
				name: "_XL."
			}
		},
