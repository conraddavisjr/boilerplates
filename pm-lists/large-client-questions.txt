Below is a list of questions that I ask before starting any large client projects.

- Metadata descriptions / Page Title
- Fonts (The files, so we have them when we work with the PSD) this is important for accuracy and it saves a lot of time when the dev is slicing the PSD and checking for font sizes.
- Tracking Specs
- Desired Features
- Mission critical Features
- The Final (live) Site URL - whats the name of the page in the URL?
- Explicit description of Timeline and deadlines for deliverables (best case, in the form of calendar notifications or verbal).
